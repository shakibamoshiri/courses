### alternative modern proxies overview (clash, xray, hy2)

There are more modern proxies like

- [clash](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo)
- [xray](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core)
- [hysteria](https://github.com/apernet/hysteria)

and sing-box is one of them, if be familiar with any, you can learn others easily

### forward proxies versus reverse proxies

We will see the differences between the two, the forward proxies

- [sing-box](https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box)
- [clash](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo)
- [xray](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core)
- [hysteria](https://github.com/apernet/hysteria)

and the reverse proxies 

- [haproxy](https://www.haproxy.org/)
- [nginx](https://nginx.org/)
- [traefikk](https://traefik.io/traefik)
- [envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/)

---

### architecture of forward and reverse

We will see the core design of forward proxies and reverse proxies

---

### singbox as reverse proxy

We will do a test of using sing-box as a reverse proxy. We see that we can make it 
work, but also we know forward proxies have not been intended to be used as a reverse 
proxy.
